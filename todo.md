# Working on
- [ ] String operations
    - Concatenation (Works only when compiled to executable by gcc)
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Dictionaries
- [ ] Foreach loop / In Keyword
- [ ] Introduce module import 

  
# Bugs
- [x] ^ Operator
 - Only works when compiler optimization is turned on.
- [ ] C-API's not in LLVM but in gcc when compiled to source
- [ ] Size overflow in ints
- [ ] Fix bug with function return types, and definitions
  
# Future 
- [ ] for(;;)
- [ ] and=, or=, <<=, >>=, xor= Operators
- [ ] Introduce String Template Literals
- [ ] Infered return type induction for functions
- [ ] Default paramaters for functions
- [ ] Spread Operator (...)
- [ ] Destructuring assignment in arrays/dicts
- [ ] Refactor

# Next
- [ ] import renaming using as keyword
- [ ] Object oriented / user defined types
- [ ] Operator overloading
- [ ] Generic Types
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Make String and arrays iterable types using classes
- [ ] Self-Hosting

# Future Stuff
- [ ] C modules support
- [ ] Garbage collection/ Better memory management.
- [ ] Threads
