# Bugs
- [ ] Size overflow in ints.
- [ ] Empty array initialization
- [ ] Proper Checking of inline functions
- [ ] Functions don't have access to the global scope.
  
# Future 
- [ ] Critical Functions mechanisms
  - var args for Functions
  - Introduce mut keyword in functions.
- [ ] Introduce String Template Literals.
- [ ] Spread Operator (...).
- [ ] Introduce module import. 

# Next
- [ ] import renaming using as keyword
- [ ] Object oriented / user defined types
- [ ] Operator overloading
- [ ] Generic Types
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] Self-Hosting

# Future Stuff
