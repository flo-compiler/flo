# Flo Programming Language
### Today
- **Implement** 
    - [~] Enums.
    - [~] Inheritance and polymorphism.
        - More tests.
    - [] Generics.
    - [] Think about access in classes and modules.
    - [] Fix fixed size arrays.
    - [] Automatic bit size casting for float and int.
    - [] pow operator.
    - [] identifiers possible to define array size.
    - [] Default class initialization.
    - [] Reformat grammar to avoid impossible structures. 
        ex: for-loop outside function body.
            or functions within functions.
    - [] Var args
    - [] Better error reporting/within functions
    - [] exceptions
- **Test**
    - Different Composite types.
    - Different Imports [x]
- **Think**
    - Think about global variables.
    - Static Ref Counting.
    - Think about all operator overloading.
    - Think about module renaming.
    - Function Overloading in classes.
    - Think about closures.
